        Returns object containing list of students inside data. Students 
        can be filtered on basis of various parameters. Each student 
        has to satisfy all parameters 
        i.e. multiple parameters are connected by `AND` operation. 
        
        `link` contains hyperlink to student's complete result.

        Response to query is paginated i.e. complete response is not returned at once.
        `pagination` has `next_cursor` whose value is needed to access more results.
        If there are no more results, `next_cursor` is an empty string. To access more result, 
        add `next_cursor` to the query with value from the response.

            Used in paging the response. This is not required when querying for first time.

            with value of next_cursor key from pagination in response. If this is empty string, it means there is no more data. 

            Eg: If value of `next_cursor` in `pagination` section of response is `17101` then to fetch more result add `next_cursor=17101` to the query.
